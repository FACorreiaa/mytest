Our highest priority is protecting and using customer data in the way our customers expect. The following data protection information will inform you about how your personal data is processed and your rights with regards to this processing, as set out in  the European General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") and other applicable data protection regulations.\n\n1.               General information\n\n1.1            The responsible entity for the operation of Ubicus Services is Hospitality Digital GmbH, Metro-Straße 1, 40235 Düsseldorf (hereafter referred to as “H.d”, “we” or “us”). H.d attaches the greatest importance to the protection of your personal data.\n\n1.2            Should you have any questions about data protection, you can contact our data protection officer using the following contact options: Hospitality Digital GmbH, Data Protection Officer, Metro-Straße 1, 40235 Düsseldorf, Germany; email: privacy@hd.digital.\n\n1.3            In this Privacy Statement, we describe how we collect, process, and use personal data in connection with the provision of our services. Personal data includes individual details about your personal or material circumstances. For example, during the registration process we ask you for your email address and password in addition to other, optional details. \n\n1.4            If you are already a customer on the DISH Platform, your data will be transferred directly from there via single sign-on (SSO). This means that you do not have to enter these details again.\n\n1.5            The personal data that we collect about you, process and use is processed exclusively within the context of the applicable statutory provisions.\n\n2.               Processing of personal data and transfer to third parties \n\n2.1            Some personal data is collected automatically from your terminal device (computer, mobile phone, tablet, etc.) when you use our services. The IP address currently used by your terminal device, the date and time, the browser type and the operating system of your terminal device and the websites you visited are logged. This data is collected to ensure data security, to optimize our offer and to improve our services. Any other data analysis, with the exception of statistical analyses that are carried out exclusively in anonymous form, will only take place within the scope of this Privacy Statement. The processing of this personal data is performed on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. The protection of our website and the optimization of our services represent a legitimate interest on our part.\n\n2.2            If you contact us (e.g. by submitting an inquiry to privacy@hd.digital), we will only collect, process and use personal data, which you have provided to us and which is required to process and respond to your inquiry.\n\n2.3            In order to facilitate the data processing operations mentioned in this Privacy Statement, we use service providers as processors within the meaning of Article 28 GDPR; such as  Cloud Hosting, maintenance and other service providers. These can be both external service providers and service providers within the METRO Group, which are located in countries within and outside the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). We ensure, through contractual arrangements, that these service providers process personal data in accordance with the GDPR to ensure a high level of data protection, including when personal data is transferred to a country where a different level of data protection is customary and for which an adequacy decision from the EU Commission does not exist. Any additional transfer of personal data to other recipients will not take place, unless we are legally obliged to do so. For more information about appropriate international data protection safeguards, or a copy thereof, please contact our data protection officer by e-mail at privacy@hd.digital.\n\n3.               Cookies\n\n3.1            We use cookies in order to make our services appealing, and to enable the use of certain functions. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your terminal device. Some of the cookies we use are deleted after the end of the browser session, i.e. after you close your browser (\"session cookies\").

By accepting our \"Cookie Banner\" you consent to the processing of your personal data by using cookies. The processing of this personal data is performed on the basis of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. In the following sections we will discuss specific cookies.\n\n3.2            We use Adobe Analytics, a service provided by Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited (4-6 Riverwalk Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24, Republic of Ireland; \"Adobe\").
